<div><p>An image is represented by a binary matrix with <code>0</code> as a white pixel and <code>1</code> as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location <code>(x, y)</code> of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.</p>
