<div><p>Given an input string<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>, reverse the string word by word.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:  </strong>["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
<strong>Output: </strong>["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]</pre>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.</li>
	<li>The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.</li>
	<li>The words are always separated by a single space.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Follow up:&nbsp;</strong>Could you do it <i>in-place</i> without allocating extra space?</p>
