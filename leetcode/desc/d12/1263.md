<div><p>Storekeeper is a&nbsp;game&nbsp;in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse&nbsp;trying to get them to target locations.</p>

<p>The game is represented by a <code>grid</code> of size&nbsp;<code>m x n</code>, where each element is a wall, floor, or a box.</p>

<p>Your task is move the box <code>'B'</code> to the target position <code>'T'</code> under the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Player is represented by character <code>'S'</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;can move up, down, left, right in the <code>grid</code> if it is a floor (empy cell).</li>
	<li>Floor is represented by character <code>'.'</code> that means free cell to walk.</li>
	<li>Wall is represented by character <code>'#'</code> that means obstacle&nbsp;&nbsp;(impossible to walk there).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>There is only one box <code>'B'</code> and one&nbsp;target cell <code>'T'</code> in the <code>grid</code>.</li>
	<li>The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box. This is a <strong>push</strong>.</li>
	<li>The player cannot walk through the box.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the minimum number of <strong>pushes</strong> to move the box to the target. If there is no way to reach the target, return&nbsp;<code>-1</code>.</p>
