<div><p>A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array <code>board</code>. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.</p>

<p>The <code>board</code> is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters <code>" "</code>, <code>"X"</code>, and <code>"O"</code>.&nbsp; The " " character represents an empty square.</p>

<p>Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").</li>
	<li>The first player always places "X" characters, while the second player always places "O" characters.</li>
	<li>"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.</li>
	<li>The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.</li>
	<li>The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.</li>
	<li>No more moves can be played if the game is over.</li>
</ul>

<pre><strong>Example 1:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> board = ["O&nbsp; ", "&nbsp; &nbsp;", "&nbsp; &nbsp;"]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The first player always plays "X".

<strong>Example 2:</strong>

<ul>
	<li><code>board</code> is a length-3 array of strings, where each string <code>board[i]</code> has length 3.</li>
